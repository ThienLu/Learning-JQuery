jQuery is a JavaScript Library created in 2006. A compilation of many common JavaScript/website tasks/features that have been condensed into much more basic and manageable methods. One of the most popular and extendable libraries out there (77% of the top million websites use it). While it's quite old (released in 2006), its still perfectly functional and still being updated. The Google hosted CDN is probably the best to use. If a user has used it before, it can be loaded from cache instead of having to redownload.
Main Features of jQuery:
- HTML/DOM Manipulation
- CSS Manipulation
- HTML event methods
- Effects and animations
- AJAX
- Utilities
